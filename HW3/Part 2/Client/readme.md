This program, executed on the Raspberry Pi with a camera module, captures live video footage. Subsequently, it processes each frame utilizing a YOLOv5 model for person detection and counting. The processed data is subsequently transmitted to the server. The script also annotates the video frames with the detection results and offers the option to display or save the annotated video.
