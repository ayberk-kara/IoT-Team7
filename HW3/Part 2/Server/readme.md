This project is a FastAPI server application designed to receive and process people count data from a device. It defines a POST endpoint that accepts JSON data containing the number of people counted and a timestamp. Upon receiving this data, the server calculates the latency between the device and the server, updates the latest count in a thread-safe manner using asynchronous locks, and records the latency for performance monitoring. Additionally, it provides two GET endpoints: /people_count, which returns the most recent people count, and /average_latency, which calculates and returns the average latency of all received data. The server runs on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) on port 80, making it accessible over the network for real-time data collection and monitoring.
